      testimonial: "I can’t thank Amy enough for the incredible transformation I’ve experienced under her guidance! When I first started my journey, I weighed 95kg and felt constantly tired, sluggish, and stuck in a cycle of bad habits. I knew I needed a change, but I didn’t know where to start. That’s when I teamed up with Amy for her gym and food plan program, and it’s been life-changing. Amy created a personalized workout routine that pushed me but was also doable, even when I was just getting started. She combined strength training with cardio in a way that kept things fresh and fun. On top of that, her food plan wasn’t about extreme diets or cutting everything out—it was about balance and sustainability. I learned how to fuel my body properly without feeling deprived. Fast forward a few months, and I’m now 75kg and feeling stronger, healthier, and more energized than I ever imagined. The weight loss was amazing, but it’s how I feel inside and out that’s the real win. I’ve gained confidence, stamina, and a whole new outlook on life. Amy’s program didn’t just help me lose weight—it helped me regain control over my health. Highly recommend! ",
